# Inline Spoilers for Obsidian
This plugin adds support for inline spoilers in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) using the `||` syntax.

## Usage
To create an inline spoiler, wrap the text you want to hide in `||`:

```
||This text will be hidden||
```

If you want to combine various formatting options, you can nest them, but make sure they are outside the spoiler:

```
**||This text will be hidden and bolded||**

*||This text will be hidden and italicized||*
```
