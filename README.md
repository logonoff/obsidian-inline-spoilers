## Usage
To create an inline spoiler, wrap the text you want to hide in `||`, or by using the "Inline spoilers: Create spoiler" command in the command palette. For example:

```
||This text will be hidden||
```

If you want to combine various formatting options, you can nest them, but make sure they are outside the spoiler:

```
**||This text will be hidden and bolded||**

*||This text will be hidden and italicized||*
```

To reveal or hide a spoiler, click on it. You may opt to always show all spoilers by enabling the "Always show spoilers" setting.
